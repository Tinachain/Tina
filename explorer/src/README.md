## About

### What is EthVM?

EthVM is an open-source Blockchain Explorer focused mainly on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) (although other networks and forks will be supported over time) under the [SSPL license](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license) (a small variation of the GNU Affero License v3) and written in a mixture of different languages. 

You can use EthVM as a tool to explore your custom private network or the existing public ones or as a ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) platform to perform different analysis on the data. 

Our core infrastructure is based on well known languages:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

And also is backed by popular frameworks:

- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) = [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/index.html) + [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) + [Kafka Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html)
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

We have choosen the above technologies to allow a wider range of people contributing to the project regardless of the programming level.

### Why Apache Kafka?

As the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/) states:

> Kafka is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies.

</div>

We believe that it fits quite nicely within the needs that a Block Explorer typically may have. On the other side, and by fully embracing the Kafka ecosystem, we allow to export the processed information very easily to other platforms.

## Roadmap

For now, we are focused on bringing a Beta environment. It will have the following:

- [x] Migration to NestJS API to replace current SocketIO API.
- [x] Migration from MongoDB to Postgres.
- [x] Improvements over processing on Kafka. We want to process the chain as fast as possible and alongside with that, squash some known bugs.
- [ ] Proper testing mechanisms on different moving parts of the system.

## Getting Started

For more information on how you can setup your environment and start developing, we recommend you to visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/EthVM/ethvm/wiki/)!

**NOTE**: Please, don't run the code blindly as there are a couple of steps you need to be aware of!
